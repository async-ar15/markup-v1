const TOOL_DESCRIPTION = `Render the supplied HTML in the user's local markup viewer (a browser window) and BLOCK until the user submits annotated feedback. Returns image content blocks (one per scroll-clustered region the user commented on) plus structured comment text. The user types comments while scrolling the artifact; you receive a screenshot of what they were looking at for each comment cluster.

Style guidance for the HTML you pass:
  • For static artifacts (specs, plans, diffs, reports, recaps, dashboards), use a clean, professional aesthetic: readable typography, semantic layout, and high-contrast styling.
  • For interactive artifacts (parameter tuners, draggable cards, clickable diagrams, design playgrounds), use a playground style: sliders, toggles, drag-and-drop, live-updating previews. Scripts run inside the iframe so anything HTML+CSS+JS is fair game.
  • The viewer ALREADY provides a universal scroll-anchored comment overlay on top of your HTML — you do NOT need to bake in your own "copy as prompt" buttons or feedback widgets unless the artifact is fundamentally about widget interaction.

This tool waits indefinitely for the user to submit. The user submits via Cmd+Enter (or Ctrl+Enter) on the floating composer at the bottom of the viewer. If the user submits with zero comments, the tool result will indicate \`annotated: false\` and you should proceed with your current plan or ask the user how to continue.`;
